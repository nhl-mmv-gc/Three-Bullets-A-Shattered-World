closet_socialists_desc:0 "Scandal in Italian East Africa, the headlines blare. The story may be a bit sensationalised, but the fact of the matter remains. Mussolini and various members of his cabinet have reportedly dabbled with Socialism! Mussolini has been quoted as saying "to hell with Colonialism!" and calling for riots in his private life. Mussolini's government has cracked down on public mentions of these rumors, but his goverment's reputation has been forever stained."
