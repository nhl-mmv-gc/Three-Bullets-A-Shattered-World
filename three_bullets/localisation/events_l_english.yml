 france.1.t:0 "Intelligence & Espionage"
 france.1.d:0 "With the increase in the funding and staffing of our intelligence services over the past few years, a dozen or so plans have been put forth for your consideration to put the department to good use, Chairman. They are wide-ranging: we can subvert governments abroad, support socialist uprisings, and start wars that would work in our favor. If you don't mind, I would like to share these plans with you on the behalf of the intelligence agency.\n\nShould you choose not to employ all of the resources at the department's disposal, the rest will be put towards domestic surveillance."
 france.2.t:0 "Liberté, Égalité, & Fraternité"
 france.2.d:0 "First of all, the twelve plans that have been devised have been split into three different groups. Each group is named after each word of the party slogan: Liberté, Égalité, and Fraternité.\n\nThe Liberté Plans focus on freeing French minorities in our surrounding neighbors, attempting to bring them under our friendly banner.\n\nThe Égalité Plans will attempt to bring the World Revolution to countries currently with large socialist movements or which would help our international influence.\n\nThe Fraternité Plans will work towards igniting current tensions abroad to forge alliances for ourselves and industrializing allied lands with the expectation that they will fight with us should we find ourselves at war.\n\nWhich plans would you like to take a look at?"
 france.3.t:0 "Fraternité Plans"
 france.3.d:0 "For the Fraternité Plans, we can focus on any of the following:\n\n-Consolidating British domestic opposition against Mosley's Leviathists,\n-Uniting the Balkan states against Italy under the banner of World Revolution,\n-Reigniting tensions in Russia to start a second Russian Civil War, and\n-Aggravating anti-German sentiment in Liberia." 
 france.4.t:0 "Égalité Plans"
 france.4.d:0 "For the Égalité Plans, we can focus on any of the following:\n\n-Manufacturing a 'Suez Crisis' in Egypt to take control of the canal,\n-Funding socialist Québécois separatists in Canada,\n-Influencing Romania's Iron Guard towards Communism, and\n-Readying socialist militias in Spain for a potential civil war."
 france.5.t:0 "Liberté Plans"
 france.5.d:0 "For the Liberté Plans, we can focus on any of the following:\n\n-Equipping socialist separatists in German-held Alsace,\n-Forming a regional separatist party in Italian-held Savoie,\n-Staging socialist protests in Swiss-held Romandie, and\n-Pulling Belgian-held Wallonia into our direct control."
 france.6.t:0 "The British Plan"
 france.6.d:0 "As mentioned, the British Plan revolves around consolidating opposition towards Mosley's Leviathism into a single movement. Currently, both the Labour Party and Liberal Party form the opposition. Though unified in animosity towards Mosley, they are not unifed in policy.\n\nThis plan will work to bridge that gap by working towards a merger of the parties. The goal is to both destabilize Britain to a point, but also bring a pseudo-socialist party into power: one which may not be friendly, but at least willing to open up trade and economic deals to us.\n\nWith the intel, establishment, and economic influence we'll gain, we could further destabilze Britain in the future.\n\nOf all the plans created, this one is definitely the most resource intensive and will take the most time to come to fruition. It is expected that 40% of our intelligence resources would go to this plan alone."
 france.7.t:0 "The Balkan Plan"
 france.7.d:0 "With the onset of destabilization in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, many southern Slavic states seceeded from the Empire or otherwise took advantage of the situation. These states included Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, and Bulgaria.\n\nWith Croatia, Serbia, and Bulgaria all vying now for influence over the other southern Slavic states, we will favor the Communist movements within all, guiding them towards an alliance between us and the policy goal of Slavic brotherhood, with a possible eventual Yugoslavian unification.\n\nUs to the west, and the Slavs to the east, our alliances will only help to bring down the Italians and will spread our ideals to the Balkan nations, giving our movement credibility within other regions.\n\nThis plan will need to subvert and go under the radar of three, potentially four, foreign governments. You can imagine this will be quite intensive on our resources. 35% of our intelligence department will need to be slated for this plan."
 france.8.t:0 "The Russian Plan"
 france.8.d:0 "With the first Russian Civil War at a standstill for over a decade and a half, the two powers left include the Holy Russian State west of the Urals, and the Russian SFSR based out of Vladivostok. Though purged over the years, socialist underground factions still exist within the HRS.\n\nWe will work to better equip and train these socialist factions and readying the Soviets for an offensive from their defensive Ural Line. This will be done not only by providing equipment and propaganda support, but also manpower should the need arise.\n\nOur current power-base in Western Europe and the potential power-base in the East will help us to bring the World Revolution to the other disparate states of Europe that are standing between the crosshairs of our two nations.\n\nThough the plan sounds like it will need a great amount of resources, it is more distance that is the trouble here. 30% of intelligence resources are needed for this plan."
 france.9.t:0 "The Liberian Plan"
 france.9.d:0 "Due to our loss in The Border War and the Revolution succeeding here in France, the Germans have been able to occupy more and more of our African holdings south of the Sahara over the years. Currently, Senegal is our only foothold to Central Africa. With German-held territory all around, anti-German sentiment has grown in Liberia over the years.\n\nOur intelligence department will start a propaganda campaign in Liberia to further aggravate this anti-German sentiment and morph it into also a pro-socialist movement. With enough pull, this will bring Liberia not only under our sphere of influence, but as a reliable foothold in Africa should we be at war with Germany.\n\nLiberia then part of the World Revolution, we can further consolidate power in Africa in the future.\n\nDistance is an issue here, but domestic intel for the Liberian government is quite low. Around 25% of our intelligence resources will be required."
 france.10.t:0 "The Egyptian Plan"
 france.10.d:0 "Though Italy and Egypt were staunch allies during and just after the uprising against the newly elected British Leviathist government, the alliance has cooled down since then. This has been not so much due to animosity, but a lack of need for the alliance on the side of the Egyptians. The only possibly hostile nation on their border is the weaker Ethiopia.\n\nAs such, we will need to create a threat from within. The plan is to manufacture a 'Suez Crisis', stationing socialist militias to lie in wait and take control of the Suez Canal. We will need to support these militias heavily though, as the socialist movement in Egypt is quite small.\n\nAs it stands, Italy has a large control of the Mediterranean. Should we take control of the Suez however, we can direct trade coming in from Asia and further our own agenda within and around the Mediterranean.\n\nAgain, a large amount of resources will need to be into this plan not only to prepare, but to see it through. 35% of the intelligence department will be needed."
 france.11.t:0 "The Canadian Plan"
 france.11.d:0 "Before our enlightened government came to power, many French nationals went abroad as part of the colonization schemes put forth by former French governments. The perhaps largest grouping of such people abroad is in Canada's Quebec region. Though they may not identify directly as French any longer, they still maintain close ties to our culture today and are even pro-socialist.\n\nWe will further funding and intelligence to the socialist and Québécois separatist movements in Canada and begin to destabilze the Canadian regime through protests and potential civil unrest.\n\nThis alliance between us as the Québécois will act as a means to both destroy the lasting Anglo cultural hegemony across the world and gain an ally which could act as a deterrant to American intervention against us.\n\nLucky for us, the United States is currently in a state of isolationism. For what it's worth, it should be easy enough to direct help across the Atlantic as long as we stray away from the British navy. We will need 30% of our department on standby for this plan."
 france.12.t:0 "The Romanian Plan"
 france.12.d:0 "Unlike many of the European nations, socialist movements within Romania are quite grassroots and do not enjoy any mainstream political influence. The largest of these groups has combined with the currently Leviathist party, the Romanian Iron Guard under Codreanu, in an attempt to become more mainstream.\n\nWith this unholy alliance between Communism and Leviathism, we yet are able to turn the situation in our favor. We will increase our socialist funding in Romania, directing more of it towards the left-wing of the Iron Guard and providing propaganda intel to the socialist leaders. Eventually, the left-wing of the party should reign supreme not only over its Leviathist counterpart, but also the country.\n\nRomania's location could act in the future as a stepping stone towards the further Balkan, Danubian, and Black Sea Revolutions.\n\nWith this plan as much a waiting game as it is a covert mission, it will take more than a few years. About 25% of our resources will be needed to bring this plan through."
 france.13.t:0 "The Spanish Plan"
 france.13.d:0 "Tensions have long been present in Spain between the Socialists, the Republicans, and the Military. Currently, republican raids against socialist factions and socialist raids against republican factions are all but an everyday occurence both in the inner cities and the rural areas. The Military hasn't helped to calm things down with its actions either. Should we light a match, we wouldn't even need to drop it.\n\nOur department intends to do exactly that with this plan. We will continue to provide all the assistance we can to the socialist factions, and will help them to stage a potential coup of the Spanish government. They're definitely strong enough to see such an action through.\n\nWith Spain in our influence, we will gain not only large control of trade within the Mediterranean through Gibraltar, but will also gain cultural connections to act through as a means to further spread the Revolution to Latin America.\n\nOf all the plans in this group, this is the least intensive. Only 20% of resources will be required."
 france.14.t:0 "The German Plan"
 france.14.d:0 "As it stands, not all of France proper is within our control. One such region is Alsace, which is currently under occupation by the German regime. The former French republican government declared an offensive war in 1915 to take the region back, but after many long years were pushed back by both the Germans and Italians. With even the British now a potential enemy, another direct war would spell our own demise.\n\nUnlike two decades ago, we will go more undercover this time. Socialist parties have been running rampant within Germany for the past several years, and have gained large popularity. With the funding we would provide through this plan, it would only be a formality that the German government turn socialist: either through popular demand, or civil war should it arise.\n\nWith Germany then under our control and their industry helping us, a strong Internationale will be able to take on both Britain and Poland should their Leviathism bring them together against our ideals.\n\nAlas, 30% of our intelligence department will be needed."
 france.15.t:0 "The Italian Plan"
 france.15.d:0 "Italian suppression of both socialist movements and French separatism has been heavy within our former region of Savoie. It has been enough that many French nationals have desired to move back within our borders. Lucky for us, our government turned them away not with sterness, but financial support, asking them to remain living in the region.\n\nWith French culture and socialist support in the hearts and minds of the French nationals prevalent, we will support the creation and protection of a regional separatist Socialist party. Should it gain enough influence in the region, we will be able to reintegrate Savoie into our control. Furthermore, with a destabilized Italian border, we will be able to expand our influence into Italy and stage an offensive to Rome should we desire.\n\nTaking out the current controller of the Mediterranean and taking their industry, intelligence, and navy with them, who could say we wouldn't control the Mediterranean then?\n\nOur first step is small, so we will only need 25% of our department to enact this plan faithfully."
 france.16.t:0 "The Swiss Plan"
 france.16.d:0 "Right now in the Swiss-held region of Romandie, ethnic French are currently the majority ethnicity, French culture is the most prevalent, and grassroot socialist movements have been springing up left and right. Even the countrywide socialist party has been able to gain a seat on the Swiss Federal Council.\n\nWith very little supression compared to what the Italians have done, the region of Romandie should be able to be extracted from Switzerland with ease. This plan includes supporting the current socialist and separatist movements, yes, but may culminate in two different ways: either staging a 'Walk on Bern' to demand a revocation of the Romandie territory to us, or a proposed socialist constitutional amendment. No matter which, Switzerland will come under our direct influence.\n\nThough we do need to be careful not to violate Swiss neutrality, successfully influencing Switzerland will expand our territory into easily-defensible mountains, and provide more offensive leverage into Italy and Germany should we need it.\n\nThe gentlemen who put this plan forth suspect 20% of our department will be required for this plan."
 france.17.t:0 "The Belgian Plan"
 france.17.d:0 "The country of Belgium has been a construct for ages. Not only is there no Belgian ethnicity, there is also no unifying Belgian culture. Most of the country is made up of Dutch-speaking Flemish, and French-speaking Walloons. And yet, Belgium has quite a large industry base, especially for its small area of control.\n\nOur intelligentsia will take advantage of these societal divides in the country and bring the Wallonians closer into our control through providing them French citizenship, welfare subsidy, and socialist propaganda. Currently, the plan includes staging large-scale protests and combining both Wallonian Socialism and Wallonian Nationalism into a single-party movement.\n\nWith a large part of Belgian industry and a new border connection to Germany, direct control of Wallonia will only help us to wage war against a possible German threat.\n\nThis plan is the least intensive of the dozen devised: only 15% of our department is required."
 france.18.t:0 "Add 15 Intel Points"
 france.19.t:0 "Add 20 Intel Points"
 france.20.t:0 "Add 25 Intel Points"
 france.21.t:0 "Add 30 Intel Points"
 france.22.t:0 "Add 35 Intel Points"
 france.23.t:0 "Add 40 Intel Points"
 france.24.t:0 "There's so many things in life I haven't gotten to do!"
 france.24.d:0 "Hang on, I'll transfer your call.
 france.25.t:0 "Human..."
 france.25.d:0 "You were never supposed to see this..."
 france.26.t:0 "Socialist March on Madrid"
 france.26.d:0 "With French support on their side, Socialists have successfully enclosed on the capital building and are voicing their desire to see our current Republican government overthrown in favor of a Socialist government.\n\nThough they claim force will be used if we don't back down, we do have some options at our disposal. We can either attempt to negotiate with the Socialists, or even bring in the Military to violently disperse the crowd. Otherwise, we may just have to give in to their demands.\n\nNo matter our choice, civil war likely waits upon the horizon."
 france.27.t:0 "Socialists Agree to Negotiate"
 france.27.d:0 "To our suprise, the Socialists have backed off from their previous statements and have voiced their willingness to negotiate with us concerning the future government. Though tensions have not calmed quite yet, we have a chance to see the end of this day with as little bloodshed as possible. Should we offer something they can't refuse? Or perhaps instead try to limit their bargaining power in the future?"
 france.28.t:0 "Socialists Decline to Negotiate"
 france.28.d:0 "The Socialists have declined the possibility of talk reconciling our two different viewpoints. Standing true to their words, we only have two options left to us: either cave to their demands and give them control of Madrid, or call in the military against the protestors."
 france.29.t:0 "Socialists Kill our Negotiators!"
 france.29.d:0 "As we looked on towards the crowd and our negotiators put their hands out, bullets riddled from a local hotel just a block away. Three of the four men we sent out were then dead on the ground. The other tried to run, but was quickly caught and stabbed. Our guards were ordered to stand down...\n\nSir? I really don't know what to think. Should we give in to these scoundrels, or put on a strong face towards them?"
 france.30.t:0 "Socialists Now Control the Capital Building!"
 france.30.d:0 "Sir! I am glad to see you made it out alright! The Socialists now control the whole of the capital building. It is currently under siege and many of the protestors have turned to rioting throughout Madrid. This is all so much to take in...\n\nI assume that a state of war now exists between us and the Socialists?"
 france.31.t:0 "Order Restored though Many Killed"
 france.31.d:0 "The military marched towards the capital building and was able to restore order to Madrid. However, many protesters and soldiers were killed in the process as the riot turned into a battle. The question is whether we declare a state of emergency or claim order reigns over all of Spain now."
 france.32.t:0 "Order Restored with Few Killed"
 france.32.d:0 "The military marched towards the capital building and was able to restore order to Madrid. Fortuneately, few protestors and soldiers were killed in the ensuing battle, though many protestors have been jailed until further notice. As long as we spin the situation as the Socialists being agitators, our government has seen very little loss of control."
 france.33.t:0 "Socialists Accept Representation"
 france.33.d:0 "With the Socialists willing to be represented in the national legislature in return for recognizing our government, they have now stood down and the capital building is no longer under siege. Unfortunately, not only has our influence over the country been lessened, but military generals and various nationalist groups have spoken out, with violence, against our compromise. With no blood being spilled today, we may yet see blood in the streets."
 france.34.t:0 "Socialists Accept Economic Control"
 france.34.d:0 "Our promise of giving economic control over to the Socialists has been deemed acceptable to them. Their protestors are now standing down, cheering as they march away from the capital building. Though they cheer and we have successfully negotiated through the situation, nationalist groups across the country have been quick to voice their concern over the events. The claim that their own militias are ready to rise up in defense of the Spanish people."
 france.35.t:0 "Socialists Accept Passing Legislation"
 france.35.d:0 "The legislation already in their hands, the Socialists were quick to accept our proposal. Though they are not in favor of the legislation, many parties in the legislature have agreed to consent to the legislation in order to suppress the possibility of civil war in our country. The largest group which still rejects it are the Leviathists, who have claimed our compromise was only a victory for internationalism."
 france.36.t:0 "Socialists Refuse to Compromise!"
 france.37.t:0 "Hm."
 france.37.d:0 "Another event you aren't supposed to see!"
 france.38.t:0 "Military Demands More Power"
 france.38.d:0 "With the 'March on Madrid' still prevalent in the minds of the Spanish people, the military has demanded that they and various nationalist groups in favor of them, be given more power over the Spanish nation. They justify their demands with the events that occured the day of the March and France, the current home of the Revolution, being right on our border. Should we hear them out, or reject all advances of their power?"
 france.39.t:0 "The Military's Demands"
 france.39.d:0 "Though their political supporters are in favor of a more hardline regime than our own, the generals are willing to work under the guise of our Republican government. Instead of regime change, they demand that a state of emergency immediately be declared, and that the military be given complete control over the local police forces. They once again have a justification: that in order to crack down on anti-social activities, such as the Socialist marches and protests, they must have free reign over all of the law-enforcing bureaucracy."
 france.40.t:0 "Military Accepts Our Negotiation"
 france.40.d:0 "The military has reluctantly accepted our negotiation and has publicly announced their support for our government. We are now unified against the Socialists."
 france.41.t:0 "Military Rejects Our Negotiation"
 france.41.d:0 "The military has vehemently rejected our negotiation and has publicly denounced their support for a more hardline regime. We are now alone in a sea of red filled with bulls."
